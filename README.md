## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, grab a cup of â˜• and explore my world of data!

I'm Marielle Cortes, a Data & Analytics Engineer and Data Scientist from Brazil. 
I currently work as a Senior Data & Analytics Engineer at Mercado Libre.

## ðŸ§  Overview of my work
With a background in Engineering and a post-graduate degree in Data Science, I am extremely proud of the journey I've undertaken as a data professional. Over the years, I've accumulated a wealth of experience covering all facets of the data universe.

I have the ability to design and execute complex end-to-end data projects, from product ideation, data collection, mining and exploration, pre-processing, developing infrastructure as code, creating ETL scripts, implementation and maintaining Machine Learning models, to developing metrics and KPI's, visualizing data and extracting insights using DataViz tools. I also take care of the internal and external dissemination of the data products developed, including data governance, best practices and the production of technical content.

My main skills include logical thinking, leadership, a solid foundation in Python and SQL programming, expertise in infrastructure as code within cloud providers, critical thinking and accurate and effective communication.
